✨ What Makes This App Stand Out?
🔮 Instant Results: Real-time salary predictions as you complete your profile.

🖤 Sleek Glassmorphic UI: Minimalist, high-contrast design for a premium and modern feel.

⚡ Built for Privacy: Data never leaves your device—your privacy is always protected.

📊 Smarter Modeling: Powered by XGBoost, one-hot encoding, and robust GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning for reliable predictions.

🎨 Custom UX: Responsive forms, stylish gradients, and motivational career quotes keep you inspired as you explore your next steps.
